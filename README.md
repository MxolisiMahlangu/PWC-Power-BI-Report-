- Supports decision-making for improving customer loyalty.

### Data Analysis

This report on data analysis will include the screanshort of how does both dashboard look like. For the full Power BI dashbord, please find the asstached document.

### Dashboard results 

The summary of the results is as follow:

**Churn Rate**:

The churn rate is 26.5%, meaning over a quarter of customers are leaving the service.

This indicates a significant customer retention issue that needs to be addressed.

**Gender Distribution**:

The customer base is evenly split between male (50%) and female (50%).

This suggests that the service is equally appealing to both genders.

**Senior Citizen Percentage**:

Only 16% of customers are senior citizens.

This could indicate that the service is not effectively targeting or retaining older customers.

**Contract Type Distribution**:

55% of customers are on a month-to-month contract, 30% on a one-year contract, and 15% on a two-year contract.

Month-to-month contracts are the most popular, but they may also contribute to higher churn rates due to lower commitment.

**Payment Method Distribution**:

Electronic check (35%) is the most popular payment method, followed by mailed check (25%), bank transfer (20%), and credit card (20%).

Customers using electronic checks may be more likely to churn due to the lack of automatic payment convenience.

**Internet Service Distribution**:

Fiber optic (50%) is the most popular internet service, followed by DSL (40%) and no internet service (10%).

Fiber optic users may have higher expectations for service quality, which could impact churn if not met.

**Average Monthly Charges**:

The average monthly charge is $64.76.

Customers may be sensitive to pricing, especially if they perceive the service as not providing enough value.

**Average Tenure**:

The average customer tenure is 32.4 months.

While this is a decent retention period, there is room for improvement, especially for customers who churn earlier.
